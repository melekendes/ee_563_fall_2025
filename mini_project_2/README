# EE 563 - Mini Project 2: Balloon Detection

#This repository contains the scripts for the "Comparison of Deep Learning Models for Balloon Detection" project.

## Scripts

# `convert_to_coco.py`: Script to convert the original balloon dataset annotations to COCO format.
# `mask_rncnn_config.py`: Configuration file for training the Mask R-CNN model.
# `ssd_config.py`: Configuration file for training the SSD model.
# `test_balloon.py`: Final comparison script that loads both models (best Mask R-CNN and best SSD) and calculates the balloon area percentage for the test images.

## Test Results

#The test images are located in the `work_dirs` folder, as required by the test script.
